# headtracker
Motion detector for general purpose via WiFi

This Project was designed in order to get and transmit via WiFi a quartenion package that can be used to determine the orientation of one probe.

The project is based on PIC18LF26K22 Microcontroller using MPU6050 and ESP8266. The code was written in XC8 compiler for MPLAB X.

Feel free to ask me questions. The Project was based on Jeff Rowberg MPU6050 DMP Library
